ðŸš— Car Model Classification Using EfficientNet
This project showcases a deep learning-based car model classifier that achieves over 90% accuracy. Using EfficientNet, it identifies car models from images, providing the top 5 predictions with probabilities. The project is deployed via a Flask web app where users can upload images for real-time classification.

Features:
High-accuracy car model classification (90%+)
Top 5 model predictions with probabilities
Real-time image uploads via a user-friendly interface
Built with PyTorch, Flask, and EfficientNet
